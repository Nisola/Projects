How to run and check that things are working:

1. Open 4 Terminals

2. In 1st Terminal, run ./build_game.sh from /game
   run ./game

3. In 2nd Terminal, from /gui, run java -jar gui_client.jar

4. In 3rd Terminal, from /team, run build_team.sh teamname, where teamname is the name of the bot in
   the file bot/teamname.ml
   For now, replace teamname with babybot.
   Run ./teamname localhost 10500

5. In 4th Terminal, run ./teamnamelocalhost 10500 in separate terminal.

6. Without anything implemented, the program should now throw an exception.
